Skeleton of an about-me page.
You'll have to put your own data into the appropriate html tags and rename the template-index.html file to index.html. 

See http://daniele.gobbetti.name for a working example.

Key advantages over other solutions:
- plain html (no special server support required)
- no javascript!
- valid hcard markup (see http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard )
- valid markup for google authorship verification (just add the appropriate rel="me" links)
- valid HTML5 (except opengraph tags in the HEAD section)
- open license: Creative Commons BY SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
- main page with space for a few profile and an additional page for all the rest (visible to search engines, invisible to users)
- looks good (at least I like it)
- probably something else
